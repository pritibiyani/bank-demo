### Story 2: **Improve Maintainability of Transaction Processing**

**Business Requirement**:  
The system’s transaction handling must be refactored to improve maintainability and scalability, as new transaction types are expected to be introduced in the future (e.g., loan repayments, interest credits, etc.).

### Context:
Currently, the transaction processing logic (for deposits, withdrawals, and transfers) might be tightly coupled, with repetitive or hard-to-maintain code. As new features are added, this setup can become error-prone, making it difficult to extend or maintain the codebase. The goal is to reduce complexity and allow the system to grow in a sustainable way.

### Why This Is Important:
- **Scalability**: As new transaction types are introduced (e.g., fee charges, loan repayments, etc.), the current code could become difficult to modify without introducing bugs. The refactor will make the codebase more flexible and adaptable to change.
- **Maintainability**: The current system likely has code duplication or complex branching logic. By improving maintainability, development speed will increase, and the code will become more readable and easier to modify.

### Possible Solutions:
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Introduce a layered architecture, separating the business logic from the data access layer and presentation layer. This will allow changes to be made in one layer without impacting the others.
2. **Design Patterns for Extensibility**: Introduce patterns like the **Strategy Pattern** for different transaction types (deposit, withdrawal, transfer). This will allow new transaction types to be added without affecting existing functionality.
3. **Modularization**: Break down the transaction logic into smaller, reusable components or services. For instance, a service for validating transactions, a service for calculating balances, and a service for processing the transaction.
4. **Testing Coverage**: Along with refactoring, improve unit testing and integration testing coverage to ensure that existing functionality does not break as changes are made.

### Example of Refactor:
Instead of having one large method or class that handles all types of transactions (possibly with multiple if/else blocks), the system can refactor transaction types into their own specialized classes or methods, following the **Single Responsibility Principle**. This way, each transaction type handles its own specific logic.

### Business Value:
- **Speed of Change**: Future changes to transaction handling (e.g., adding new types) can be made faster, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.
- **Lower Technical Debt**: By cleaning up the codebase now, the development team avoids accumulating technical debt that could slow down future development.
- **Scalability**: The system becomes more modular, allowing for easier feature expansion as the business grows.

This story focuses on improving the system’s structure so that it can handle future growth and changes efficiently while delivering better long-term value to the business.
