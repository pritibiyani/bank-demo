###  Banking Application 

This is a simple banking ledger that provides general ledger functionality along with maintaining the balance accuracy and transaction history. 

The application has to be build initially as multi build project. 

###  Stories 

#### Story 1: Enable Basic Banking Transactions
Business Requirement:
The system must allow customers to perform basic banking transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between accounts while maintaining correct account balances and an audit trail.

**Possible Solutions:**
Implement a basic transaction module that supports deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between customer accounts.
Set up logging or auditing functionality to keep track of all transactions for compliance.
Use a relational database to store customer balances and transaction records to ensure consistency and durability of data.
**Business Value**:
Provides foundational banking features, enabling core customer activities and ensuring transparency in transaction records, which fosters trust.

#### Story 2: Improve Maintainability of Transaction Processing
**Business Requirement:**
The systemâ€™s transaction handling must be refactored to improve maintainability and scalability as new transaction types are expected to be introduced.

**Possible Solutions:**
Refactor the transaction logic to follow clean code principles (such as separation of concerns) to make it modular and extensible.
Introduce a service layer that separates the transaction business logic from the presentation and data layers.
Apply the Strategy Pattern to allow flexible addition of new transaction types (e.g., loan payments, interest credits) without major changes to the core logic.
**Business Value:**
By improving the system's maintainability, new transaction types or features can be added faster and with lower risk, ensuring continuous improvement of the system while minimizing technical debt


#### Story 3: Ensure High Performance Under Heavy Transaction Load
**Business Requirement:**
The system must efficiently handle a large volume of concurrent transactions without degrading performance or compromising data consistency.

**Possible Solutions:**
Introduce an event-driven architecture using message brokers (e.g., Kafka) to decouple transaction processing and ensure scalability.
Implement optimistic locking or transactional queues to handle concurrency and ensure transactional consistency across multiple accounts.
Use caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data (e.g., account balances) to reduce database load during peak transaction periods.
**Business Value:**
Ensures that the system remains performant even as the customer base and transaction volumes grow, improving user experience and reliability, and supporting business expansion.


#### Story 4: Enhance System Resilience with Fault Tolerance Mechanisms
**Business Requirement:**
The system must remain resilient and continue functioning in the event of partial failures or service disruptions during transaction processing.

**Possible Solutions:**
Implement circuit breakers and retry mechanisms to handle temporary failures when interacting with external systems or databases.
Use distributed transaction management (such as a saga pattern) to ensure that multi-step processes (e.g., multi-account transfers) complete successfully or roll back cleanly.
Introduce monitoring and alerting systems to detect and recover from failures quickly.
**Business Value:**
Increases system reliability and ensures business continuity by reducing the impact of service failures on customer transactions, thus maintaining trust and minimizing revenue loss.
